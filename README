Here are the steps to create a Pomodoro timer app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

First, create the HTML structure for your Pomodoro timer. You will need to create a container element to hold the timer, and within that create an element to display the time remaining in the current Pomodoro. You may also want to include buttons for starting and stopping the timer, and resetting it to the default time.

Next, style the timer using CSS. You can use CSS to style the container, the time display element, and the buttons. You might want to give the timer a distinctive color scheme, and use font styles to make the time display easy to read.

Once you have the HTML and CSS set up, you can use JavaScript to create the timer functionality. You will need to create a function to start the timer, one to stop it, and one to reset it to the default time. You will also need to update the time display element with the current time remaining in the Pomodoro.

To make the timer work, you will need to use JavaScript's setInterval function to update the time remaining in the Pomodoro at regular intervals. You will also need to use clearInterval to stop the timer when the user clicks the stop button.

Finally, you may want to add some additional features to your Pomodoro timer. For example, you could include an option to customize the length of the Pomodoro, or you could add a feature to track how many Pomodoros the user has completed.
